## 🔧 Step 5 Technical Implementation

### Database Enhancements

```sql
-- New tables for invoice tracking
CREATE TABLE invoices (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    contact_id INTEGER,
    stripe_invoice_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    stripe_customer_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'draft',
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    hosted_invoice_url TEXT,
    invoice_pdf TEXT,
    payment_intent TEXT,
    paid_at DATETIME,
    amount_paid DECIMAL(10,2),
    finalized_at DATETIME,
    -- ... additional columns
);

CREATE TABLE invoice_items (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    invoice_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    watch_id INTEGER,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    -- ... foreign keys
);
```

### Webhook Integration

```javascript
// Payment event handlers
router.post('/stripe', async (req, res) => {
  const event = JSON.parse(req.body);

  switch (event.type) {
    case 'invoice.payment_succeeded':
      await handleInvoicePaymentSucceeded(event.data.object);
      break;
    case 'invoice.payment_failed':
      await handleInvoicePaymentFailed(event.data.object);
      break;
    case 'invoice.finalized':
      await handleInvoiceFinalized(event.data.object);
      break;
    // ... additional event handlers
  }
});
```

### Frontend Components

- **PaymentResult.tsx**: Handles payment redirects and status display
- **Enhanced PaymentsPage**: Integrates payment result flow
- **Real-time status updates**: Syncs with Stripe for current status

---

## 🚀 Complete Workflow

### 1. Invoice Creation

```
User creates invoice → Stripe customer created/updated →
Hosted invoice URL generated → Invoice saved locally →
Customer redirected to Stripe payment page
```

### 2. Payment Processing

```
Customer pays → Stripe processes payment →
Webhook updates local status → Customer redirected to result page →
Status confirmed and displayed
```

### 3. Status Synchronization

```
Webhook events → Local database updates →
Real-time status sync → Frontend displays current status
```
